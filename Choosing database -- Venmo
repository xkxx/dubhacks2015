Choosing database

MySQL
MongoDB		not relational, shared r/w
Redis		all in memory, fast, heavy r/w load
Cassandra	distributed


How to choose:
	data size
	working set
	write and read load
	the way to handle inconsistencies
		need atomic transactions or not
		delay
		work with other data sources

Data size
	mysql
		matual sharding
	mongoDb
		build in sharding

working set size
	mongo
		working set should fit in RAM
	redis
		cannot exceed the amount of RAM on the machine
	mysql, mongoDb
		less important

read/write load
	redis
		great for heavy loads
	mongo
		moderate loads
	mysql
		moderate
	cassandra
		heavy read only

inconsistence
	support atomic transaction: cassandra, mysql, redis
	eventual consistency: all
	dependent on another data source (should avoid)

Good at:
	mysql, mongo
		scan
		filter
		join
		index
		==> general data
		e.g. user accounts, places

	cassandra
		querying a single reference or a row of data
		limited ablity to filter
		==> data grows exponentially, reads are minimal and queries are simple
		e.g. user interaction data

	redis
		key-value store
		don't scan
		==> updated very often, read very often
		e.g. friends feeds, Oauth tokens
		e.g. eference in redis + data in mysql
